## What is `BProbeM`?

`BProbeM, a fuzzy quantum geometry scanner`, is a [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) package. It is the implementation of an algorithm which rasterizes the semi-classical limit of a fuzzy brane described by a set of matrices. 

BProbeM is an updated [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) of [BProbe](https://github.com/lschneiderbauer/BProbe), adding several features for scanning such as the newly added directional scans, improves and completes missing documentation and improves computational time by changing how some internal procedures are handled.

The underlying theory is not described in this document, for a comprehensive treatment please refer to [the paper introducing the original BProbe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.08007).

## Installation & Getting Started

Please see the [project wiki page](https://github.com/TSGut/BProbeM/wiki/Installation-&-Getting-Started) and the example notebooks provided in the Examples folder of this repository.
